##Environment set up
To set up the environment, we will need to install Conda in our system (https://conda.io/en/latest/).
Once Conda is installed, the next step is to create the environment from the environment.yml file:
`conda env --file environment.yml`
Now, we are ready to run the `jupyter notebook` command to build up the jupyter notebook.
